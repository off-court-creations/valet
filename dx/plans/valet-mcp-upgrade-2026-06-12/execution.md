# valet-mcp Upgrade — Execution Log

> Executing [`plan.md`](./plan.md) on `feat/valet-mcp-upgrade` (off
> `feat/valet-overhaul` @ `0f5ebce`). Driven by Claude (ultracode, Opus
> subagents). Status legend: ⬜ not started · 🛠️ in progress · ✅ done+verified
> · ⚠️ caveats · ⏸️ blocked.

## Master checklist

| Wave | Contents | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Lane A extractor correctness (A1 getComment normalizer · A2 phantom filter · A3 call-site deprecation) ‖ Lane C zod→SDK bump · then B gate hardening + corpus regen | ✅ |
| 2 | D1 validate_jsx (headline) · D2 structuredContent/outputSchema · D3 isError · D4 deprecation-aware output · D5 cwd parity fix | ✅ |
| 3 | E1 Select examples · E2 wording fixes · E3 docs/AGENTS/README/CHANGELOG + final regen | ✅ |

## Provisional rulings (assessment §Decisions, reversible)
SDK minor tilde-bump (no major exists) · validate_jsx is the headline ·
tools-only (no resources/prompts churn) · relationship graph SKIPPED this
effort. Escalate only on: SDK bump forcing a breaking rewrite, or validate_jsx
against shipped types needing a heavy new dep.

## Acceptance test (whole effort)
Feed `<Table selectable='multi' rowKey='id'>`: (a) get_component marks
selectable/rowKey deprecated + replacement; (b) validate_jsx flags them.

## Wave log

### Wave 1 — foundations — ✅

**Lane A (extractor):** `commentText()` normalizer flattens ts-morph's
`string|(string|JSDocNode)[]` via `compilerNode.text` + `{@link}` target
reconstruction (the slice's prescribed `getText()` accessor was wrong — agent
corrected it and documented why), applied at all FOUR JSDoc sites (the two
named + a third alias-path description map + the inherited-symbol path); bare
`catch{}` swallows narrowed so errors surface. **Result: 0 `[object Object]`
in the corpus; 11 deprecated props now flagged with replacements** (4 more than
the assessment's 7 — Switch.onChange, RadioGroup.spacing, Panel.normalizeRowHeight,
Pagination.onChange were also silently losing their flag). A2 phantom filter
(`unquoteName` dedupes the Drawer aria-label double-count; destructured-default
props only emit when public-type members → Drawer.anchorProp / Avatar.loading
gone). A3 call-site deprecation: parses `resolveDeprecatedProp`/`deprecateProp`
call sites into an authoritative `{component→{alias→{replacement}}}` map merged
into props (robust source that can't array-coerce). Regression fixtures fail on
pre-fix code.

**Lane C (currency):** zod → single deduped `3.25.76` (closes the zod/v4 hazard
— `npm ls zod` shows one version); SDK `^1.3.0`→tilde `~1.29.0`, **mechanical
bump, no escalation** (registerTool/registerResource style already modern);
build + selfcheck green, versionParity true. (`@cfworker/json-schema` is an
optional 1.29 peer only needed for JSON-schema input — we use zod raw shapes,
so intentionally absent, warning-clean.)

**Lane B (gate):** validate.mjs now FAILS on `[object Object]` descriptions,
on unexpected `type:'unknown'` public props (allow-list documented), and on a
known deprecated alias missing its flag — closing the "freshness ≠ correctness"
gap. Each gate bite-tested.

**Verification:** both reviewers **pass**. Gate: lint ✅ tsc ✅ **1241/1241**
✅ mcp:schema:check ✅ mcp:check ✅ check:examples ✅ valet-mcp build+selfcheck
✅. Acceptance-test half (a) achieved: get_component now marks selectable/rowKey
deprecated with replacement.

### Wave 2 — server DX — ✅

**Lane 1 (output contract):** D5 cwd-parity fix (version resolved from
bundled `_meta.json` / module graph, never `process.cwd()` — parity now
correct under any host cwd, proven from `/tmp`); D3 `isError:true` on genuine
lookup misses (get_component/get_examples/define_term) while empty SEARCH
stays a non-error empty list (14-tool audit); D2 `outputSchema` +
`structuredContent` on get_component/search_props/list_components (Zod shapes
from ValetComponentDoc); D4 deprecation surfaced in both text and structured
output (consumes Wave-1 flags) — search_props no longer presents an alias as
canonical. 13-test in-memory Client↔server round-trip.

**Lane 2 (validate_jsx — the headline, NO escalation):** new
`src/validate/typecheck.ts` (ports example-types machinery, parameterized for
the valet module specifier; layered resolver: package-exports →
package-entry → repo-dist → repo-src) + `src/tools/validateJsx.ts`. Warm
~51ms/call (cold 1.24s), well under budget. Catches invented props, wrong
literal unions, AND deprecated aliases against the **shipped** types —
14-test suite + the four plan cases. typescript moved devDep→dep;
`@archway/valet` added as an **optionalDependency `^0.35.0`** (degrades to
`isError` when valet absent, works in-repo via the workspace, self-contained
once 0.35.0 publishes — does NOT poison the tarball).

**Integrator + reviews:** integrator caught a real D2 bug — passing
`outputSchema: Schema.shape` dropped `.passthrough()`, so the SDK rejected the
corpus's extra fields at every get_component call; fixed by passing the schema
instance. Review 1 caught a **ship-blocker** (the original `file:../..` valet
dep poisoned the published tarball → broke install) → fixer switched to the
optionalDependency. Orchestrator then fixed two `checkJs` gaps the scoped runs
missed (the new `.mjs` test needed JSDoc types) + the prettier auto-fixes.
**Full gate:** lint ✅ tsc ✅ **1268/1268** ✅ build ✅ check:engine ✅
check:examples ✅ mcp:check ✅ valet-mcp build+selfcheck (versionParity true,
15 tools) ✅. **Acceptance test COMPLETE:** get_component flags
selectable/rowKey deprecated→replacement AND validate_jsx rejects them.

**Note for Ben (informational):** validate_jsx's optionalDependency resolves a
real valet only once `@archway/valet@0.35.0` is published (latest is 0.34.1).
Until then it works in-repo (workspace) and degrades to a clean `isError` in a
published install; the other 14 tools are fully functional regardless.

### Wave 3 — curated gaps + docs — ✅ TIER 1+2 COMPLETE

**E1 (examples):** the assessment flagged Select's zero examples; the audit
found 36 zero-example components, and E1 added **15 examples across 10**
(Select ×3 incl. the FormControl/createFormStore pattern, plus Checkbox,
RadioGroup, Radio, Slider, IconButton, DateSelector, Stack, Icon, Divider) —
**example coverage 22→32 components, 99 examples, all type-checked by
check:examples**. Caught its own `IconButton variant='outline'`→`'outlined'`
before the gate. **E2 (wording):** Button/IconButton `variant='contained'`
(MUI-ism) → `filled`; surfaced Button `type='submit'`/`'reset'`; a repo-wide
grep sweep confirmed no other variant/size literal was wrong. **E3 (docs):**
CHANGELOG entry for the whole upgrade; AGENTS.md MCP section now tells agents
to use validate_jsx to self-check; README + docs MCP.tsx document the 15 tools,
structured output, and validate_jsx (with the optionalDependency caveat stated
honestly).

**Verification:** both reviewers **pass**; the exit-audit confirms every
slice A1/A2/A3, B1, C1/C2, D1–D5, E1/E2/E3 landed. Final gate: lint ✅ tsc ✅
**1268/1268** ✅ build ✅ check:engine ✅ check:examples (99) ✅
mcp:schema:check ✅ mcp:check ✅ docs build ✅.

## DONE — Tier 1 + Tier 2 complete

The maintainer's question answered in code: **the MCP no longer lies** (0
`[object Object]`, 11 deprecated props serve their canonical replacement, and
content gates make recurrence unshippable), it's **current** (SDK ~1.29, single
zod 3.25), and it gained the **closed correctness loop** — `validate_jsx` lets
an agent typecheck valet JSX against the real 0.35.0 types and self-correct.
Acceptance test passes end-to-end. Branch `feat/valet-mcp-upgrade` stacks on
the unpublished overhaul; publishing both (valet 0.35.0 → valet-mcp 0.35.0) is
Ben's per dx/RELEASING.md — that publish is also what flips validate_jsx's
optionalDependency to a real resolution in consumer installs.

**Tier 3 (deliberately not done, per the assessment + ruling):** code-derived
composition graph (subsumed by validate_jsx's type-level nesting enforcement)
and scaffold prompts — available if Ben wants them later.

## CI hardening (first real Actions run, 2026-06-13)

The first real GitHub Actions run surfaced failures the dev tree masked
(commits `df2250c`, `4c7b66e`):
- **typecheck:scripts TS2307** — root `npm ci` doesn't install valet-mcp /
  create-valet-app deps (no workspaces), but typecheck:scripts covers the CVA
  bin + (via validate-jsx.test) valet-mcp src. Fix: core job installs both
  sub-packages before typecheck. (Reproduced: 7 TS2307 with deps hidden.)
- **CVA js + hybrid templates LINT:fail** — eslint configs lacked
  `parserOptions.ecmaFeatures.jsx`, so espree couldn't parse `.jsx`. Fix
  applied to both templates; all 13 cva:validate scenarios pass.
- **check-fresh "9 stale"** — ts-morph emitted `import("/home/xbenc/…").Space`
  (absolute, host-specific) into 9 prop types. Fix: strip the import()
  qualifier in extract-ts cleanType; new validate.mjs gate forbids it; corpus
  regenerated. Also excluded the gitignored `_ts-extract.json` from
  check-fresh (absent in clean checkouts).
- **validate-jsx + check-bundle** — needed dist/, but `npm test` ran before
  `npm run build`. Fix: build-before-test in ci.yml (reproduced: 10 fails
  dist-hidden → 27/27 with dist).
- **aiKeyStore on Node 20** — `.buffer` ArrayBuffer rejected cross-realm by
  Node 20 webcrypto under jsdom. Fix: pass TypedArray views (BufferSource).
  Verified under a real Node 20.20.2 install (8/8); full suite **1268/1268 on
  both Node 20 and 22**.

**Already-published caveat (minor, for a future patch):** valet-mcp@0.35.0 was
published from the maintainer's machine BEFORE the import()-strip fix, so its
served corpus carries `/home/xbenc/…` absolute paths in ~10 prop `type`
fields. Cosmetic/path-leak only (types still readable; not functional); a
valet-mcp 0.35.1 with the clean corpus would resolve it. The aiKeyStore
BufferSource fix likewise isn't in published valet@0.35.0 — real browsers
accept `.buffer`, so only the Node-20+jsdom test path was affected; ships in
the next library patch.

## Flags & issues
1. Branch bases on `feat/valet-overhaul` (NOT development) — all referenced
   assets (deprecate.ts, example-types.mjs, schema 1.7, 0.35.0 renames) exist
   only there. The overhaul itself is still unpublished/unmerged (Ben's
   hand-off list); this MCP work stacks on it.
