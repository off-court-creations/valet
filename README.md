`valet` is a CSS-in-JS engine, a UI component kit, and an accessibility layer that treats all humans and their AI proxies as first class users.

Please expect many breaking changes but feel free to check it out!

When `1.0.X` drops hop in and depend on that thing!

`valet` is pronounced like the British attendant but pronouncing it like the car attendant is also very cool and encouraged.
Unless you don't like `valet` in which case its pronounced like the British attendant and go make `valet2` and tell us about it.
