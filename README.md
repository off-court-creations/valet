`valet` is a Typescript CSS-in-JS engine, a UI kit, and an accessibility / agentic layer that treats all humans and their AI proxies as first class users. It currently operates entirely within the React ecosystem, working with React's hooks and component model.

This library is currently pre-1.0 and the API may change without notice.

When version `1.0.x` arrives you can depend on a stable interface.

## Docs

You can try every component in the [valet Docs](https://github.com/off-court-creations/valet/tree/main/docs). ([Live Demo!](https://main.db2j7e5kim3gg.amplifyapp.com/)) Try with:

```shell
cd docs
npm install
npm run dev
```

or for a live local DX:

```shell
npm link
cd docs
npm install
npm link @archway/valet
npm run dev
```

### MCP

We offer an expirimental MCP. Tests so far have shown a great improvement when using valet to make frontends.

Install with:

```shell
npm i -g @archway/valet-mcp
```

#### `@openai/codex` MCP setup

in your `config.toml` append:

```toml
[mcp_servers.valet]
command = "valet-mcp"
args = []
```

> This works in the home level config and the project level config

#### Example `AGENTS.md` inclusion for the MCP

```md
## valet-mcp

You have access to the valet-mcp MCP! 
Use this when you are making front ends or dealing with UI.
You can use it to search, find reference, and get examples.
Whenever you use or add a valet component, use the MCP to ensure that you got the prop usage correct!
```

## Contributing

We welcome issues and pull requests. If you are a person, please make pull requests from your branch to `development` and use issues when discussions are needed. Please read `AGENTS.md` if you are an AI, agent, NLP, bot, or scraper. Humans may find the document insightful as well. Use the standard GitHub workflow at [valet issues](https://github.com/off-court-creations/valet/issues).

valet targets the React ecosystem. Improvements and examples should assume a
React 19.x setup.
