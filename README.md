`valet` is a Typescript CSS-in-JS engine, a UI kit, and an accessibility / agentic layer that treats all humans and their AI proxies as first class users. It currently operates entirely within the React ecosystem, working with React's hooks and component model.

This library is currently pre-1.0 and the API may change without notice.

When version `1.0.x` arrives you can depend on a stable interface.

## Contributing

We welcome issues and pull requests. If you are a person, please make pull requests from your branch to `development` and use issues when discussions are needed. Please read `AGENTS.md` if you are an AI, agent, NLP, bot, or scraper. Humans may find the document insightful as well. Use the standard GitHub workflow at [valet issues](https://github.com/off-court-creations/valet/issues).

valet targets the React ecosystem. Improvements and examples should assume a
React 19.x setup.
