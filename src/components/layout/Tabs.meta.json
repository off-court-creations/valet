      "Use Tabs to switch peer views that don’t require navigation changes; use routes for deep navigation.",
      "Keep labels short and stable; avoid wrapping to multiple rows—enable horizontal scroll when needed.",
      "Provide sensible initial selection and preserve it across renders/routing.",
      "Respect overflow: allow swipe/drag to scroll when the strip exceeds width; show edge fades to hint at more content.",
      "Ensure keyboard navigation: Arrow keys move focus, Enter/Space activates.",
      "Prefer tokenized spacing and motion for a cohesive feel.",
      "Avoid mixing tabs and inline navigation within the same strip.",
      "Use appropriate variants and placement to reflect app hierarchy.",
      "Announce active tab for screen readers with `aria-selected` and `role=tablist`."
