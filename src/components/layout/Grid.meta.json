      "Use Grid for two‑dimensional layouts like dashboards and galleries; keep rows and columns responsive.",
      "Constrain item overflow and prefer consistent gaps; avoid nested scroll regions unless intentional.",
      "Treat tabular data with `Table`; reserve Grid for cards and visual groups.",
      "Use tokens and presets for spacing and breakpoints; avoid hard‑coding pixel values.",
      "Keep density readable: don’t cram too many items per row on narrow screens.",
      "Use `Stack` for simple one‑dimensional layouts; Grid for when both axes matter.",
      "Mind a11y ordering: visual reflow should not break logical reading order.",
      "Test at common breakpoints to ensure content doesn’t clip or overlap."
