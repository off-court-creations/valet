      "Use for secondary navigation or tools; avoid blocking critical flows (use `Modal` for decisions).",
      "Coordinate with AppBar and Surface so the drawer doesn’t overlap or hide important content.",
      "Use persistent vs temporary modes appropriately; auto‑collapse on narrow screens.",
      "Keep content scannable and avoid deep nesting; provide headings for sections.",
      "Prefer tokens for backdrop colour and motion; keep transitions aligned with theme."
