      "Use for short, scannable sections. Keep headers concise and content lightweight.",
      "Choose single vs multiple expansion by context; avoid opening many sections by default.",
      "Control model deliberately: use `open` + `onOpenChange` for app‑driven state, or `defaultOpen` for uncontrolled.",
      "Respect heading levels. Set `headingLevel` so the outline remains semantic within the page.",
      "Constrain height in dense pages so the thread scrolls locally rather than the document.",
      "Prefer keeping content mounted unless heavy: use `unmountOnExit` to remove expensive trees when closed.",
      "Ensure keyboard support: Space/Enter toggles, Arrow keys move focus, and focus styles are visible."
