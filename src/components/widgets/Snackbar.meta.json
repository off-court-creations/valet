    "bestPractices": [
      "Keep messages short and specific. Snackbars confirm actions or provide brief status; avoid long instructions or multi‑step interactions.",
      "Place them consistently, typically bottom center/right depending on platform.",
      "Offer a single, clear action when needed; prefer undo when appropriate.",
      "Respect motion and timing. Use `autoHideDuration` for transient messages (3–6s typical); longer durations should be deliberate.",
      "Don’t stack excessively. Queue messages when necessary; ensure important ones aren’t missed.",
      "Keep focus behavior intact. Snackbars shouldn’t steal focus; any action button must be keyboard reachable.",
      "Style via tokens/presets. Use theme colors for status (e.g., `primary` / `error`) and consolidate variants with `preset`."
