      "Use sparingly. SpeedDial is for a small cluster of high‑value actions (typically 2–5). If you have more, consider a toolbar or menu instead.",
      "Place with intent. Default bottom‑right works well; adjust offsets with spacing tokens to avoid overlapping content or platform UI (e.g., safe areas).",
      "Label actions clearly. Provide short, specific labels; the component exposes them via `title` and keyboard focus when open.",
      "Close on action. After invoking an action, collapse the dial so the UI returns to a stable state and prevents accidental re‑taps.",
      "Pick direction by context. Choose `up` / `left` when anchored to bottom/right edges to prevent overflow. Keep action order predictable.",
      "Motion tokens. Animations use theme motion tokens; keep custom presets aligned for a cohesive feel with the rest of the app."
