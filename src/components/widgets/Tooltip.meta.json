      "Use tooltips for supplemental hints, not essential instructions. The UI should remain usable without hovering.",
      "Ensure the trigger is focusable and labelled. For iconâ€‘only controls, provide `aria-label` on the target.",
      "Keep content concise; avoid interactive controls inside tooltips. Prefer short phrases over sentences.",
      "Prefer `placement='top'` when space allows; adjust placement to avoid clipping and viewport edges.",
      "Use sensible delays. Avoid long `enterDelay` / `leaveDelay` that make tooltips feel sluggish or sticky, especially on touch devices."
