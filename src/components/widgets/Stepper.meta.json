    "bestPractices": [
      "Treat Stepper as presentation. It reflects progress; do not use it as the sole navigation control. Provide explicit Next/Back controls and validate each step.",
      "Bind `active` to canonical state. Derive from router or form state rather than local UI assumptions. Clamp to `0…steps.length-1` when updating.",
      "Keep labels short and stable. Prefer 1–2 words. For lengthy flows, consider numeric or icon labels and place detailed titles above the content.",
      "Mind accessibility. Announce progress with text like `Step X of Y` near the Stepper so screen readers have context.",
      "Use tokens/presets to style. Customize radius/stroke via CSS vars and presets rather than per-instance inline styles to keep density and branding coherent.",
      "Keep step count reasonable. If there are many steps or non‑linear paths, a progress bar or checklist may be clearer."
