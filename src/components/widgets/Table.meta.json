      "Keep tables readable: enable `striped` and/or `hoverable` for large datasets, but avoid heavy styling that competes with content.",
      "Constrain height (`constrainHeight`) so the body scrolls inside the table instead of the page scrolling in two directions.",
      "Provide an initial sort (`initialSort`), align numeric columns to the right, and format dates consistently.",
      "Enable selection only when followâ€‘up actions operate on selected rows; choose `single` vs `multi` to match the action design.",
      "Keep column count reasonable on narrow screens; prefer fewer, more meaningful columns over many cramped ones. Use succinct headers."
