      "Label the group clearly. Provide a visible prompt (e.g., a preceding `Typography` ) and ensure `name` is set so the group behaves as a single form field.",
      "Choose controlled vs uncontrolled deliberately. Use `value` / `onChange` when the selection drives app state; otherwise, `defaultValue` is sufficient.",
      "Align to available space. Use `row` for short option lists in wide layouts; prefer a column for long labels or narrow screens.",
      "Keep targets comfortable. Use token sizes ( `'sm'` .. `'xl'` ) or numeric values to maintain touch targets ≥ 40–48px depending on density.",
      "Avoid nesting interactive content inside labels. Keep each option’s label succinct and non-interactive so keyboard and screen reader navigation remain predictable.",
      "Use presets for visual variants. Capture chip/pill styles with `definePreset` and apply via `preset` so branding and states stay consistent."
