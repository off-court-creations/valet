      "Establish a clear action hierarchy: use `contained` for the primary action and `outlined` for secondary/tertiary actions. Keep emphasis consistent within a view.",
      "Choose sizes by density: `sm` / `md` for typical forms, `lg` for standout CTAs. Avoid mixing sizes within the same control group.",
      "Prefer theme tokens ( `primary` , `secondary` , `tertiary` ) for automatic contrast. If you set a custom `color` , also set `textColor` to keep contrast accessible.",
      "Use `fullWidth` in narrow or linear layouts (mobile, drawers) where the button should span the container. Otherwise let content define width.",
      "Prefer succinct verb‑first labels. If the action is icon‑only, use `IconButton` and provide an accessible label via `aria-label` .",
      "When combining icons and text, add a small gap (e.g., `` on the icon) for readable spacing.",
      "Reuse styling with `preset` ( `definePreset()` ) rather than duplicating `sx` across instances.",
      "Avoid multiple primary actions per view and reserve destructive styles for destructive operations."
