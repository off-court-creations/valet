      "Provide an accessible name. Icon‑only buttons must include `aria-label` describing the action (e.g., 'Delete item', 'Play'). Avoid vague labels.",
      "Pick variants by emphasis. Use `contained` for primary/high‑affordance actions and `outlined` for secondary/tertiary actions. Keep colour from theme tokens and avoid unbounded custom colours.",
      "Size for touch. Use token sizes (`'xs'` … `'xl'`) or numbers to maintain comfortable targets on mobile.",
      "Toggle semantics. When the button toggles state, add `aria-pressed` to reflect the current state; tooltips are optional and should not replace labels.",
      "Choose `icon` vs `svg` deliberately. Prefer `icon` for Iconify glyphs; use `svg` only for custom/brand artwork. Do not pass both at once.",
      "Keep ripple/motion subtle. Align custom presets with the theme’s motion tokens for a cohesive feel."
