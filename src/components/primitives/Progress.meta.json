    "Use determinate bars when percent is known; spinners for unknown durations.",
    "Provide accessible labels (e.g., `aria-label` or nearby text) that explain what is loading.",
    "Avoid blocking the entire page—prefer inline or section‑level indicators when possible.",
    "Use theme colours to convey status (e.g., `error` for failures) and tokens for size.",
    "Don’t rely solely on colour; pair with text or icons for critical states.",
    "Keep motion subtle and aligned with the theme’s motion tokens."
