    "Prefer well‑known glyphs and keep sizes consistent with surrounding text or controls.",
    "Provide accessible labels when icons are actionable or convey status.",
    "Avoid using colour alone to convey meaning; pair with text or status tokens.",
    "Use tokens/presets for colour and size; avoid ad‑hoc CSS to preserve consistency.",
    "Don’t overload meaning—keep one concept per icon and avoid ambiguous metaphors."
