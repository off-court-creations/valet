This directory stores preserved environment and CI configs that were replaced.

- env/.nvmrc — previous Node version pin used by nvm
- ci/amplify.nvm.yml — the prior Amplify config using nvm and `.nvmrc`
- ci/amplify_old.yml — an even older Amplify config kept for reference

These are retained for historical reference and easy rollback.
