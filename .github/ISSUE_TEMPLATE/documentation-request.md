**Is your documentation request related to a specific problem? Please describe.**  
A clear and concise description of what’s unclear or missing.  
_Ex. The “Getting Started” guide doesn’t show how to configure multiple themes, so I’m unsure which settings apply._

**Describe the change you’d like in the docs**  
A clear and concise explanation of the update you’re proposing (e.g., add examples, clarify terminology, include edge-case guidance).

**Describe alternatives you’ve checked**  
A brief list of resources you’ve consulted (existing docs, tutorials, code comments) or other ways you’ve tried to resolve this.

**Additional context**  
Add any other relevant context, links, or screenshots that would help clarify your documentation request.
